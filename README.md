- Built an analytics pipeline for the ingestion of data from a new [Voice product](https://voicebot.ai/2020/06/02/bbc-voice-assistant-beeb-launches-in-beta-in-the-uk/) that was being built in the same department.
    - Expanded this to support ingestion from multiple sources including [Alexa devices](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0957KX2C4) and Rest APIs.
    - Between June 2022 and August 2023 the pipeline ingested more than 1.1 Billion records and more than 1.1TB of data.

    - Added local news and weather forecasts for users with linked BBC accounts
    - Reached a peak of 175k unique users in a day
    - The skill handled a peak demand of ~64k Lambda invocations in a minute.

- Using the [BBC's Synthetic Voice](https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/worldnews/2020/life-project) produced a pipeline generating 12,000 weather forecasts every day, these were used in both the [Interactive News Alexa Skill](https://voicebot.ai/2019/10/23/bbc-launches-interactive-news-service-for-alexa/) and the [BBC's Weather app](https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/articles/c7219x55vygo).
    - On Alexa devices it achieved more than 3 million playbacks of the forecast, with a completition rate of &gt; 97%, reaching 95% of the UK's postcodes.
